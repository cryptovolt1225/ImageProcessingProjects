#**Image Processing Projects**

This repository is a collection of all things fun in image processing achieved with opencv and python. Projects and implementations are ever so on random topics but interesting ones nevertheless.

 1. Image_Lib - contains common code files that is reused by most projects.
 2. PyImageSearchProblems - Kudos to Adrian for his awesome blog on image processing in opencv - [PyImageSearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/). The files in this folder mostly follow some of his blogs with my flavor to the problems here and there.
 3. PythonProjects - My playground! Every time someone mentions or I think of an interesting problem, it ends up here.
 4. SelfProjectUtils - Code that I usually use to understand images for tuning parameters in other projects and such.
